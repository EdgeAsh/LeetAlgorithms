In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Note:

The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
The size of given string array won't exceed 600.
 

Example 1:

    Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
    Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
 

Example 2:

    Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".

### 分析
第一，从短字符串先匹配消耗最小。
第二，等长的字符串里先消耗0/1中个数多的那个能匹配更多

假如，0多1少(m>n)
字符串长一点，但是包含更多的0
字符串短，但是包含更多的1.
这种情况该怎么选择呢，是有可能颠覆短串优先的。
每匹配完一个，都会对后面的匹配产生影响；怎样能确认前面匹配的是最优？

既然只有0/1.每个字符串里0/1个数是一定的吧
